            "1" : "Quizzz was my first project at the Wild Code School. The purpose was to experiment with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It was completed in two weeks with my collaborators, Matthieu and Victor. Your objective is clear: defeat the Grim Reaper. You have three lives for 12 questions. Can you beat him?",
            "2" : "Tech'tastik is a SoloRush project completed in 24 hours. This exercise aimed to help us get familiar with React, focusing on component creation, props handling, and filter implementation. For this purpose, I decided to create an application offering quirky tech gadgets for sale. Looking for gift ideas? Check out the website!",
            "3": "MeteoApo is a project completed in 36 hours as part of a Protojam. Two requirements were set at the beginning: create an application on the theme of the apocalypse and use an API. We decided to repurpose the data from a weather application (Weather Stack) to calculate your survival chances based on the selected city. Ready to calculate your chances?",
            "4": "Heracles' Labour is a small game inspired by the 12 Labors of Hercules. The goal is to work with JavaScript to practice object-oriented programming. No application will be deployed for this project, but the code is available on GitHub. Ready to face the Nemean Lion? Clone the repository and start the game from your code editor's terminal using the following command: node index.js",
            "5": "MusicWild is the second project we completed at Wild Code School and our first Full-Stack project. This team effort, conducted with Christine, Célio, Aurélien, and myself, followed the agile/scrum methodology. Through this project, we explored server-side development using Express to make API calls. MusicWild is a music website powered by the Deezer API, allowing users to browse through several dynamic routes to play music previews of their choice (30 seconds per track). Ready to relax and enjoy some tunes?"
