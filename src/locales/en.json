        "presentation": "With an initial background in dietetics and solid experience in personalized support, I am now reinventing myself as an application developer. Currently retraining to obtain the Application Designer and Developer certification, I am specializing in JavaScript and full-stack development. Passionate about web technologies and innovative solutions, I particularly enjoy the richness of this field, which combines creativity, logic, and constant evolution. Already familiar with the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I am eager to deepen my knowledge and take on new technical challenges. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring other passions: reading, playing tennis, and engaging in activities that nurture my analytical mindset and curiosity.",
        "portfolio": "This portfolio was created to showcase my most accomplished projects. Entirely coded in React, its code is available as open source on my GitHub for developers or anyone curious to explore it. It is designed for both professionals in development and those who simply want to discover my work and projects. In line with the training provided by the Wild Code School, each project (or nearly all) was developed following best practices: wireframe creation, prototyping with Figma, and adherence to Agile/Scrum methodologies. It's a great personal joy to be able to share this work with you. If you are reading these lines, I just want to say a simple and heartfelt: Â« Thank you ! Â» ðŸ˜Š"

It was completed in two weeks with my collaborators, Matthieu and Victor. Your objective is clear: defeat the Grim Reaper. You have three lives for 12 questions. Can you beat him?",
            "2" : "Tech'tastik is a SoloRush project completed in 24 hours. This exercise aimed to help us get familiar with React, focusing on component creation, props handling, and filter implementation. For this purpose, I decided to create an application offering quirky tech gadgets for sale. Looking for gift ideas? Check out the website!",
            "3": "MeteoApo is a project completed in 36 hours as part of a Protojam. Two requirements were set at the beginning: create an application on the theme of the apocalypse and use an API. We decided to repurpose the data from a weather application (Weather Stack) to calculate your survival chances based on the selected city. Ready to calculate your chances?",
            "4": "Heracles' Labour is a small game inspired by the 12 Labors of Hercules. The goal is to work with JavaScript to practice object-oriented programming. No application will be deployed for this project, but the code is available on GitHub. Ready to face the Nemean Lion? Clone the repository and start the game from your code editor's terminal using the following command: node index.js",
            "5": "MusicWild is the second project we completed at Wild Code School and our first Full-Stack project. This team effort, conducted with Christine, CÃ©lio, AurÃ©lien, and myself, followed the agile/scrum methodology. Through this project, we explored server-side development using Express to make API calls. MusicWild is a music website powered by the Deezer API, allowing users to browse through several dynamic routes to play music previews of their choice (30 seconds per track). Ready to relax and enjoy some tunes?"
